## Overview:
Stargate is an e-commerce website that focuses on the sale of computer parts and associated products. 
It aims to create an accessible storefront in the PC culture and make the cutting edge of technology less daunting for individuals of all technical skill levels, especially beginners and new customers who want to enter into the worlds of PC gaming, video editing, or other hobbies requiring more dedicated systems. 
This has been achieved by implementing an independent recommender system for PC building, and adding user-friendly functionalities such as a compatibility checker, and a performance reviewer.
