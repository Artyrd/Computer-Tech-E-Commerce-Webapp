# Week 1 #

## What was finished? ##
- In our first lab, we brain stormed the potential technologies to use in our 
  E-commerce website project: React, Material UI, MongoDB, and Node.js.
- This was preferred over a Python backend like in comp1531 as it uses more 
  modern technologies to get us real-world practice.
- Conveniently, CSEsoc is hosting a MongoDB Workshop, which will cover 
  MongoDB+Mongoose+Express.js as a backend!
- In addition to everyone contributing to user stories, I was assigned to do the 
  preliminary draft of the system architecture for our project.
- The user stories i contributed towards were related to: 
  {Admin funcitonality, Accounts, Security, and Support}

## What is next? ##
- Adding story points, priorities, and transfering user stories to Jira
- Finish the architectural diagram for the Project Proposal
- Start coding up the website

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Week 2 #

## What was planned: ##
- Adding story points, priorities, and transfering user stories to Jira
- Finish the architectural diagram for the Project Proposal
- Start coding up the website

## What was finished: ##
- For the user stories I contributed to, I added story points, priorities, 
  and then transferred them over to the Jira board.
  * Transferring over to Jira on a trackpad was difficult and cramp inducing.

- I created a diagram and wrote up contextual information on the architectual 
  choices for the app. In addition to the MERN stack, Libraries were included:
    REST API, Material UI, MongooseJS, PassportJS
  * For the Architectural Diagram, it was especially difficult to source
    standard guidelines for drawing up the diagram.
  * Alot of time was consumed finding the relations between objects, and how
    each design component communicates with one another.

- Architectural Diagram update:
  * Switched database from MongoDB to SQLite
  * Updated diagram and write-up accordingly

- I ran the basic initialisations for React frontend and Express backend
  * using yarn as the package manager.
  * SQLite database not yet to be linked

## What's next? ##
- Finalise Project Proposal
- Continue coding sprint 1


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Week 3 #

## What was planned? ##
- Finalise Project Proposal
- Start coding sprint 1

## What was done? ##
- We had a meeting Tuesday 11am - 12pm
  * Plans for the first sprint and finalising Project Proposal

- Project Proposal:
  * Proofread Maggie's background writeup in the Project Proposal
  * Contributions for Project Proposal done

- Project Sprint 1
  * Barebones SQLite database created in the repo
  * Template routes and controllers created, with readme's for other devs
  * Self-learning with various articles and youtube videos on the 
    javascript ecosystem

## Obstacles ##
- n/a

## What was not finished ##
- n/a

## What is next?
- Barebones admin adding products and editing products
- Serving products to a user
- Other database dependant functionality


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Week 4 #
## What was planned? ##
- Barebones admin adding products and editing products
- Serving products to a user
- Other database dependant functionality

## What was done? ##
Database:
- products table and tags table created
  - tags table separate for easy many-many relation.
  - tags table is de-normalised for easier querying, as the name of the tag
    can be directly extracted with 1 less call.

- orders, sales, and order_sales tables created
  - 'sales' details which (1) product got sold for what price
  - 'orders' are the overall order details such as:
     customer info, date, total price
  - 'order_sales' shows which 'sales' belong to which 'order' 
     (many-one relation)
  - eg: order#23 contains the sales of products #2, #34, #98.
     
Routes:
- (admin) add, edit, delete products routes done.
- view product(s) routes done
- placeorder, editorder, vieworder(s) routes done


## Obstacles ##
- the version of sqlite available with knex (the npm module 'sqlite3') is not
  up-to-date with the latest version (>8 months old), which meant that the
  autogenerated 'id' of products and orders could not be returned after an insert,
  as this was a feature released with sqlite3 version 3.35, 
  while the 'sqlite3' node module is on version 3.32.
- wrapping my head around using async, await along with promises, but by now
 I've established a sort of template.

## What was done? ##
- Backend sales statistics for maggie's graphs.
  - Popular items
  - Sale stats with filtering options

  - Products showing their discounted price
  - orders and sales also reflect the discounts

## Obstacles ##
- It was a big struggle to figure out the query to narrow sale stats within a date range.
- Adding discounts meant all product related methods had to be rehauled to check current discounts first.
  - orders and sales also had to check for the discounts and account for gross/net price
